  <h2>A Comprehensive Guide to Trading and Cybersecurity</h2>
  <p>
    Trading is one of the most trending terms that almost everyone has heard in recent times. Trading is not a new concept, but it was relatively unfamiliar to large masses of people until the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. During the lockdown, many companies initiated large-scale layoffs as part of cost-cutting measures, which resulted in widespread unemployment and severe financial instability in numerous households. People started looking for alternative income sources and were particularly attracted to opportunities that promised quick earnings.  As the market crashed and some HNIs (High networth individuals) with Bearish strategies were able to make money exploiting the volatility of the market. This is when a large section of the population began to actively explore trading ,

  <p>and since then, many Retail investors have entered the markets driven primarily by the desire for fast and effortless money. Speaking of numbers, more than 10 million new individuals started trading in just one year of 2020.</p>

  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Trading is primarily conducted online, which means participants are constantly exposed to the broader internet and, more importantly, to cyber threats. Cybercriminals continuously attempt to identify vulnerabilities and loopholes in systems, and once they discover one, they try to extract as much sensitive information as possible. Online trading platforms and their servers store large volumes of confidential data such as account details and passwords, which, if compromised, can be easily exploited. It is therefore not only the platform's responsibility but also the user's duty to safeguard personal data. This is where cyber security becomes crucial. Cyber security focuses on safe digital practices that every trader must follow to protect personal information, account credentials, and most importantly, money.</p>

  <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
  <p>Cyber security is the discipline of protecting computers, networks, software, and data from unauthorized access, cyberattacks, damage, or disruption. It involves a coordinated framework of technologies, processes, and policies designed to secure digital systems and information against threats such as hacking, malware, phishing, and ransomware. The core objective of cyber security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets.</p>

  <h2>Trading</h2>
  <p>Online trading refers to the electronic buying and selling of financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds, derivatives, and currencies through internet-based platforms. It enables investors to execute trades from virtually anywhere using digital devices, offering greater convenience, speed, and control compared to traditional offline methods. In online trading, a trader opens an account with a broker, deposits funds, and uses trading software or applications to place buy and sell orders in the market.</p>

  <h2>Core Discussion </h2>
  
  <ol>
  <li><h3>Base of trading:</h3></li>
  <p>As explained above, trading is executed through internet-based platforms and requires specific software to complete the entire trading process. The term "internet-based platform" here refers to servers that manage and store all the information related to buying and selling activities. The trading software acts as the interface that allows users to send and receive information from these servers. The most critical component that connects users to these servers is the internet itself. The internet is vast and interconnected, with millions of users, among whom some of the most dangerous are hackers.</p>

  <li>
  <h3>Danger:</h3>
  </li>
  <p>Hackers typically possess an in-depth understanding of networks and systems, which enables them to design various strategies to deceive users and obtain their credentials.<br>For example, they may create fake websites that closely resemble genuine trading platforms, making it extremely difficult for an average user to differentiate between the two. Unsuspecting users may end up entering their usernames and passwords on these fraudulent sites, unintentionally handing over complete access to their accounts and assets. </p>

  <li>
  <h3>Role of cyber security:</h3>
  </li>
  <p>This is why awareness of safe internet practices is essential. There are many other techniques that attackers use, such as phishing, malware, and ransomware. One of the purposes of Cyber security is to provide structured guidance on how to identify and avoid such traps.  We will talk further in this blog how cyber security guides us through this.<br>Hackers can not only deceive users directly but can also discover vulnerabilities and loopholes in servers and software.</p>
  <img src="posts/CS and trading/Picture2.jpg" alt="Hacker trying to find a vulnerability">
  
  <p><b>Once they gain access to critical systems:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>They can manipulate how data is processed.</li>  
    
  <li>They can artificially influence the way stock prices appear to move.</li> 
  
  <li>They can tamper with the trading algorithms on the server.
  </li>
  <li>Large volumes of sensitive data, including usernames and passwords, can be exposed.  
  </li>
  <li>Bank credentials may be leaked and misused, including being sold on the dark web .
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>The combined impact of such activities can lead to severe financial instability across different regions, and in extreme scenarios, even across multiple countries.
</p>
  <li>
  <h3>Preventative measures:</h3>
  </li>
  <p>To prevent such disastrous situations, following are the measures  taken by cyber security experts and retail investors are supposed to take:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Securing trading platforms.</li>
    <li>Protecting personal and financial data.</li>
    <li>Ensuring regulatory compliance.</li>
    <li>Preventing insider trading through cyber breaches.</li>
    <li>Securing cryptocurrency trading environments.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In this blog, the focus is on practical precautions that an individual retail trader should follow. <br>Let us now look at the protocols every trader/investor should take to prevent these consequences.
  </p>
  </ol>
<ol>
  <li>Protect Your Personal Information</li>
  <p>This is the most fundamental step to staying safe online. Never share sensitive information such as PAN details, Aadhaar number, bank account details, OTPs, signatures, or personal photographs. Sharing such information can directly lead to fraud and identity theft. In many cases, attackers can also use personal details to guess or reset passwords.
  </p>

  <li>Keep Your Devices Updated</li>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, software often contains vulnerabilities and loopholes that are discovered over time. Developers release updates and security patches to fix these weaknesses. If you do not update your operating system and applications regularly, attackers who are aware of known vulnerabilities can exploit them to gain unauthorized access to your device.
  </p>

  <li>Always Use a Secure Private Network</li>
  <p>While performing any financial activity online, always connect through a secure, encrypted, and preferably private network rather than public Wi-Fi. On unsecured or poorly configured networks, attackers can intercept the data your device exchanges with the router if the communication is not properly encrypted, exposing your login details and other sensitive information.
  </p>

  <li>Use Only Trusted and Regulated Platforms</li>
  <p>There are numerous websites and applications that claim to be "100% safe and secure," but not all of them genuinely protect your data. As mentioned earlier, hackers can design sophisticated fake platforms to mislead users. These websites can appear highly professional and trustworthy while being malicious. To verify legitimacy, you can:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Check the URL to ensure it starts with "https" and has the correct domain.
    </li>

    <li>Review the website's security certificates.
    </li>

    <li>Search for the platform's reputation, user reviews, and any reported history of phishing or malware incidents.
    </li>

    <li>Consult an expert or knowledgeable person in case of doubt.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</li>
  <p>After creating your trading and banking accounts, always enable two-factor authentication in the security settings. This acts as an additional layer of defense. Whenever someone attempts to log in to your account, you will receive a verification prompt or notification on your registered email or mobile number. If an attacker manages to obtain your password, 2FA can still prevent unauthorized access and gives you time to change your credentials immediately.
  </p>

  <li>Enable Alerts</li>
  <p>Activate SMS and email alerts for all transactions and changes made to your trading and bank accounts. Real-time notifications help you continuously monitor your accounts and quickly detect any suspicious or unauthorized activity.
  </p>

  <li>Use Secure Payment Methods</li>
  <p>When making any online transaction, always use trusted payment gateways or well-established payment services to protect your financial details. Using insecure or unknown payment tools may expose your card or bank information, which attackers can later use to perform unauthorized transactions.
  </p>

  <li>Use Strong and Unique Passwords</li>
  <p>Using weak passwords is one of the biggest security mistakes. Simple passwords can be guessed or cracked quickly using automated tools. Avoid using easily identifiable information like phone numbers, dates of birth, names, or common words. Always create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Equally important, never reuse the same password across multiple accounts. If one account is compromised, attackers will immediately try the same password on your other accounts.
  </p>

  <li>Log Out After Use</li>
  <p>After completing your trading or banking activities online, always log out from your accounts, especially on shared or public devices. If you remain logged in, attackers may exploit stored session data or cookies to gain access and take over your accounts without needing your credentials again.
  </p>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>These cyber security practices will help protect you and your data not only while trading but also during every interaction with the internet. Based on an analysis of 500 investors, It was found that 15% of current investors came into market in 2020. And this new wave of investors in called as the Generation investor. The firm surveyed 1,000 Americans ages 21 to 75 among a diverse range of demographics and found that 476 of respondents invest in the stock market.
